                <h1>Risk Factors Impacting the Prevalence of Diabetes in the United States</h1>

                <h3>Diabetes and Its Importance</h3>
                <p>
                    Diabetes refers to a set of diseases that results in high blood glucose, coming in two main types: type 1, where the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to regulate oneâ€™s blood sugar level, and type 2, where the pancreas does make insulin, but the body is unable to use this insulin optimally. Diabetes is a major global health concern, affecting millions of people of all ages, potentially increasing the risk for those with diabetes to have serious health complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and vision loss. Those suffering from diabetes, especially in the United States, often bear a large financial burden to afford their life-sustaining insulin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several factors can increase the chances of oneâ€™s development of diabetes, including obesity, physical inactivity, an imbalanced diet, high blood pressure, and their familyâ€™s history of the disease. Age also plays a role, as the risk increases with aging, and certain ethnic groups are more predisposed to developing diabetes. Investigating the factors that lead to diabetes through visualization and data analysis is essential for prevention, early diagnosis, and effective management of the disease, as well as unlocking the ability to develop targeted public health strategies, promote lifestyle modifications, and create better treatment options to reduce the growing prevalence of diabetes to help millions of individuals worldwide.

                <h3>Our Dataset</h3>
                <p>
                    This investigation uses the "Diabetes 012 Health Indicators" dataset from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015, collected by the CDC. It includes health-related risk behaviors, chronic conditions, and preventive service usage. The dataset contains 253,680 patient observations and 22 attributes, exceeding the 10,000-observation limit for this project. To comply, we randomly sampled 10,000 observations while preserving the distribution of the target variable (Diabetes 012). If needed, stratified sampling was used to ensure proportional representation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This dataset provides a broad view of key diabetes-related health indicators, enabling analysis of correlations between lifestyle factors and diabetes risk. It includes both categorical (e.g., smoking status, general health) and continuous variables (e.g., BMI, mental health days), making it suitable for visualization and modeling.
                </p>








                <br />
                <p>The Diabetes (012) variable classifies individuals as follows:</p>
                <ul class="data-translation" style="padding-left: 40px">
                    <li>0: No diabetes</li>
                    <li>1: Prediabetes or borderline diabetes</li>
                    <li>2: Diagnosed diabetes</li>
                </ul>
                <br />

                <h3>Feature Importance</h3>
                <p>
                    Below is a lollipop chart representing the top 12 most important features used to predict diabetes using a Random Forest Classifier. These features span general health indicators, lifestyle choices, and demographic factors.
