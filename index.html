        <h3>Diabetes and Its Importance</h3>
        <p>Diabetes refers to a set of diseases that results in high blood glucose, coming in two main types: type 1, where the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to regulate oneâ€™s blood sugar level, and type 2, where the pancreas does make insulin, but the body is unable to use this insulin optimally, also leading to a high level of blood glucose. Diabetes is a major global health concern, affecting millions of people of all ages, potentially increasing the risk for those with diabetes to have serious health complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and vision loss. Those suffering from diabetes, especially in the United States, often bear a large financial burden to be able to afford their life-sustaining insulin. Several factors can increase the chances of oneâ€™s development of diabetes, including obesity, physical inactivity, an imbalanced diet, high blood pressure, and their familyâ€™s history of the disease. Age also plays a role, as the risk increases with aging, and certain ethnic groups are more predisposed to developing diabetes. Investigating the factors that lead to diabetes through visualization and data analysis is essential for prevention, early diagnosis, and effective management of the disease, as well as unlocking the ability to develop targeted public health strategies, promote lifestyle modifications, and create better treatment options to reduce the growing prevalence of diabetes to help millions of individuals worldwide.</p>

        <br />
        <h3>Our Dataset</h3>
        <p>This investigation uses the "Diabetes 012 Health Indicators" dataset from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015, collected by the CDC. It includes health-related risk behaviors, chronic conditions, and preventive service usage. The dataset contains 253,680 patient observations and 22 attributes, exceeding the 10,000-observation limit for this project. To comply, we will randomly sample 10,000 observations while preserving the distribution of the target variable (Diabetes 012). If needed, stratified sampling will ensure proportional representation of diabetes categories. This dataset provides a broad view of key diabetes-related health indicators, enabling analysis of correlations between lifestyle factors and diabetes risk. It includes both categorical (e.g., smoking status, general health) and continuous variables (e.g., BMI, mental health days), making it suitable for visualization and modeling.</p>

        <br />
        <p>The Diabetes (012) variable classifies individuals as follows:</p>
        <ul class="data-translation" style="padding-left: 40px">
          <li>0: No diabetes</li>
          <li>1: Prediabetes or borderline diabetes</li>
          <li>2: Diagnosed diabetes</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <h3>Feature Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Because the development of diabetes is a complex, multifaceted medical
          issue, there are many warning signs that can come into play when
          trying to predict the onset of the disease. Some factors are well
          within a patient's control, and would serve as the basis for advice
          given to a patient from their doctor about controlling lifestyle and
          habits, while some factors are genetically predisposed and not up to
          the control of the patient. Some factors, however, are somewhere
          in between. For example, a patient's cholesterol level is somewhat
          dictated by their diet and exercise choices, yet also many people
          are genetically predisposed to high cholesterol. Thus, we found it
          useful in this analysis to divide the most important features into
          two sections that can be individually addressed by our visualizations
          and analysis: uncontrollable (or immutable, both are used
          interchangeably), which represent health/lifestyle predispositions
          that are fully or mostly out of control of the patient, and
          controllable (or mutable), which are factors that are fully or mostly
          in the patient's control. Dividing the factors into these categories
          not only makes each visualization more cohesive and contextual, but
          can allow both doctors and patients alike to focus on factors that
          are actively in the patient's control, while placing potential
          lifestyle changes within the context of the patient's past/family
          medical history.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <p>
          But what factors are the most important to analyze in the first
          place? Below is a lollipop chart representing the top 12 most
          important features used to predict diabetes using a Random Forest
          Classifier to determine which features were the most effective
          and important in predicting the classification of each patient's
          diabetes status. Thus, of the top 12 most important features,
          six were placed under the "mutable" category, and the other
          six under the "immutable" category. 
        </p>

        <ul class="features" style="padding-left: 40px">
          <li>Immutable</li>
          <li>Age</li>
          <li>Blood Pressure</li>
          <li>BMI</li>
          <li>Cholesterol</li>
          <li>General Health</li>
          <li>Sex</li>

          <li>Mutable</li>
          <li>Education</li>
          <li>Fruits and Vegetables in Diet</li>
          <li>Income</li>
          <li>Mental Health</li>
          <li>Physical Health</li>
          <li>Smoking Status</li>
        </ul>

        <br> </br>

        <p>
          It is important to note that although it is possible to make
          lifestyle changes that can impact one's BMI in hopes of mitigating
          one's risk of diabetes, because there are so many genetic
          predispositions to one's BMI, and because of all of the
          interconnectedness that one's BMI has with other health and
          genetic features, it made the msot sense to group BMI with the other
          immutable features.

          Furthermore, physical health and mental health are separate from
          general health, as general health refers to the complex network
          of genetic disease, family history, lifestyle, and bodily composition.
          In contrast, physical and mental health are measured simply by
          identifying the number of days per month that one feels physically
          or mentally unwell, respectively, which is, for the most part, a
          mutable quantity. Thus, a high mental/physical health refers to
          <i>fewer</i> days per month feeling unwell, and a low mental/physical
          health refers to <i>more</i> days per month feeling unwell.
