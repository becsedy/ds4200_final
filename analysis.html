            <h2>Project Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                Our analysis of diabetes health indicators reveals several
                significant insights about the relationship between diabetes diagnoses and various health factors.
                We began with the general purpose of seeing if we could determine the likelihood of diabetes to be linked to 
                several mutable and immutable indicators. 
            </p>

            <p> 
                We split the controllable factors and uncontrollable factors evenly from the 12 highest features calculated via a random forest
                feature importance calculation. A general view of the demographic information of the dataset provides a start towards answering our hypothesis
                on the likelihood of having a diabetes diagnosis -- for each diagnosis category, there was a notable increase in rate
                of diagnosis for each category past 50 years of age. However, when we examined each "mutable" and "immutable" factor, these relationships were 
                harder to define using this dataset. 
            </p>
            <p>
            For the mutable/changeable characteristics, the Patient Similarity Network brought us our most important insight: patients are distributed throughout the network rather than concentrated in specific regions,
            indicating that controllable factors (smoking, diet, physical/mental health, income, and education) may have less predictive power for diabetes than clinical models suggest.
            for the immutable/unchangable characteristics, the correlation matrix brough us our strongest insight: a weak positive correlation between diabetes diagnoses and the six immutable health indicators
            examined (High Blood Pressure, High Cholesterol, BMI, Age, Sex, General Health).

            Again, While not conclusive enough to establish strong predictive relationships, the consistent pattern of weak positive correlations with diabetes diagnosis and weak negative correlations with 
            non-diabetic status suggests a trend worthy of further investigation.
